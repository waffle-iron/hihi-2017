Why is reflection important?
Reflection helps the brain move new knowledge from the short term memory into the long term memory. It's also effective as a source of assessment of one's progress, be it self-assessment or otherwise.

What did I do well this week?
I started out the week well. Real nice like. I was powering along until it became clear that I was missing some waffles and wasn't powering on as swiftly as I thought.
I'm pretty happy with my little website too. I could tweak that puppy for days. I never feel like I'm finished with a website. There's always something I want to nudge, but I'm happy with it anyhoo.   

What could I have done to improve?
It would have been wiser to NOT try installing a dual-boot of Ubuntu onto my Windows machine. That pretty well consumed about two days of allocated EDA time. This time lost, coupled with the very real thought that I had idiotically broken my Windows, heightened my stress levels somewhat. I have Windows back, but still no Ubuntu. Many thanks on that score to those that helped. Particularly Alan and Bev. I haven't given up, I'm just a hell of a lot more cautious now. The more difficult it is, the more I want it.

To improve, it would've been a good idea to start that tiny meditation habit during the periods of higher anxiety. I didn't though. I'll try and learn from that.
